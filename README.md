# A Paint Company
 IS18 Full Stack Developer 
 
This is a ReadMe file for the Paint Company Stock Status web application, which provides a platform for managing and monitoring the availability and inventory of paints used by A Paint Company. The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and follows an Agile development approach. The application allows different user roles to access and perform specific actions based on their responsibilities.

## Features
1. User Authentication: The application supports three different user roles: Manager, Admin, and Painter. Each role has specific access rights and permissions within the system.

2. Paint Status Dashboard: Managers and Admins can view the current status of all paints, organized in swim lanes representing the availability, running low, and out of stock status. They can easily track the availability of paints and manage the inventory accordingly.

3. Inventory Management: Admins can update and edit the inventory of paints based on bulk orders. They can access the edit functionality, enter the necessary information, and update the inventory accordingly. The updated inventory is reflected in real-time on the paint status dashboard.

4. Running Low Alert: Painters can mark a specific paint as "running low" if they notice that the quantity is decreasing. This allows the managers and admins to be aware of paints that need attention and take necessary actions to replenish the stock.
